# nr-msg-statistics
A library to offer a ring buffer for Node-RED msg statistics

The purpose of this library is to share (msg statistic related) functionality between some of my Node-RED nodes, like e.g. [node-red-contrib-msg-speed](https://github.com/bartbutenaers/node-red-contrib-msg-speed) and [node-red-contrib-msg-size](https://github.com/bartbutenaers/node-red-contrib-msg-size).
